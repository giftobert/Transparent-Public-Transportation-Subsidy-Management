# Transparent Public Transportation Subsidy Management

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based solution for managing public transportation subsidies with complete transparency and accountability. Our system uses smart contracts to verify recipients, issue benefits, track usage, and prevent fraud in public transit subsidy programs.

## Core Components

### Recipient Verification Contract
Validates eligibility for transit subsidies through secure identity verification and qualification assessment processes.

### Benefit Issuance Contract
Manages the distribution of fare assistance to qualified recipients, ensuring timely and accurate disbursement.

### Usage Tracking Contract
Monitors actual transportation utilization by subsidy recipients to measure program effectiveness and inform policy decisions.

### Fraud Prevention Contract
Identifies suspicious patterns in subsidy usage through advanced analytics and implements automatic safeguards against misuse.

## Key Features

- **Transparent operations**: All subsidy transactions are recorded on a public blockchain
- **Privacy-preserving**: Personal identification data is protected while maintaining accountability
- **Real-time auditing**: Continuous monitoring of program usage and effectiveness
- **Cost-efficient administration**: Automated processes reduce overhead expenses
- **Data-driven policy**: Usage analytics inform future transportation subsidy programs
